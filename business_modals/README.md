## 1. Provider Subscription (B2B SaaS) — “Patient MRI Clarity as a Service”
* Who pays: hospitals / neurology groups / imaging centers
* What they buy: a packaged workflow that generates a patient-friendly MRI summary + longitudinal tracking that reduces follow-up friction.
* Pricing: annual contract per facility or per service line (Radiology + Neuro), optionally tiered by volume
* Value story: better patient experience + fewer clarification calls + more consistent longitudinal comparisons
* Why investors like it: recurring revenue, high retention, expansion potential across service lines
* Upsell: add “longitudinal tracker” + “patient portal export” + “multi-site rollups.”


## 2. Per-Study Reimbursement-Aligned Model (B2B Usage-Based) — “Pay per MRI Summary”
* Who pays: hospital / imaging center (or payer if it evolves)
* What they buy: a per-MRI processing fee for a supplemental, educational summary delivered to the patient.
* Pricing: $X per scan processed (with volume discounts); minimum monthly commit
* Value story: low-risk pilot-friendly, easy procurement (no big upfront)
* Why investors like it: scales with imaging volume, clean unit economics, simple to forecast
* Investor wedge: start with neuro/MS; expand to stroke follow-up, TBI, tumor surveillance, dementia workups.


## 3. Enterprise Licensing + Integration (EHR/PACS) — “Platform + Workflow Integration”
* Who pays: health systems (enterprise) + imaging IT budgets
* What they buy: licensing + integration into PACS/EHR + security/compliance packaging + governance controls.
* Pricing: platform license + implementation fee + support/maintenance
* Value story: system-wide standardization, reduced variability, centralized reporting
* Why investors like it: large ACV, multi-year contracts, defensible moat (workflow + integrations)
* Moat builder: once embedded into imaging workflows, switching costs rise sharply.


## 4. Patient Premium (B2C) — “MyMRI Companion”
* Who pays: patients directly (or via employer wellness)
* What they buy: longitudinal dashboard + storage + comparisons + plain-language education + share-to-doctor features.
* Pricing: freemium → premium subscription; family plan
* Value story: patient autonomy and understanding across years of MRIs
* Why investors like it: huge market, viral/referral potential, direct distribution
* Important: keep clinical risk low with strong disclaimers + “discuss with your clinician” guardrails.


## 5. Research & Pharma (B2B) — “Imaging Biomarkers + Cohort Analytics”
* Who pays: pharma, CROs, academic research labs
* What they buy: standardized lesion quantification + cohort-level analytics for trials (de-identified), plus tooling.
* Pricing: per-study contract + recurring platform access for ongoing trials
* Value story: trial endpoints, faster analysis, reproducibility
* Why investors like it: high-margin services early → platform revenue later
