# NIH SBIR / STTR — Translational & Commercialization Grant (Draft)

## Project Title
**A Scalable MRI Intelligence Platform for Lesion Analysis, Longitudinal Tracking, and Patient-Readable Reporting**

---

## Project Overview

This project proposes the translation of a validated neuroimaging analysis pipeline into a **scalable, cloud-deployed MRI intelligence platform** that supports automated lesion detection, atlas-based regional quantification, and longitudinal analysis of brain MRI studies. The platform is designed to generate **clear, non-diagnostic, patient-readable summaries** that support improved understanding and communication while remaining complementary to clinician interpretation.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion analysis serves as the initial target application, with a clear pathway to expansion across other neurological imaging use cases.

---

## Commercial Objective

The primary objective is to **commercialize a secure, cloud-based MRI intelligence platform** that can be deployed in healthcare and research environments to improve interpretation, consistency, and longitudinal understanding of MRI findings.

This SBIR effort focuses on:
- productization of validated methods
- pilot deployments with healthcare partners
- scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS)
- preparation for broader market adoption

---

## SBIR Phase I / Phase II Focus

### Phase I: Feasibility and Pilot Validation
- Package the existing MRI analysis pipeline into a production-ready cloud service
- Validate technical feasibility, performance, and reliability
- Generate pilot-ready outputs (reports, metrics, APIs)
- Conduct limited pilot evaluations with partner sites

**Phase I Outcome:**  
Demonstration of technical feasibility, pilot readiness, and early market validation.

---

### Phase II: Scaling, Integration, and Market Expansion
- Expand cloud infrastructure for increased throughput and reliability
- Integrate with imaging workflows (e.g., DICOM ingestion, secure storage)
- Refine reporting, usability, and deployment tooling
- Prepare regulatory, security, and operational documentation

**Phase II Outcome:**  
A scalable, deployable MRI intelligence platform ready for broader adoption.

---

## Technical Innovation

The platform integrates several innovations into a unified product offering:

- AI-based lesion segmentation producing voxel-level probability maps  
- Atlas-based aggregation to generate region-level lesion burden vectors  
- Longitudinal comparison across MRI timepoints  
- Explainable mapping from anatomical findings to functional domains  
- Automated generation of structured, patient-readable reports  

This approach moves beyond single-model inference to deliver **interpretable, repeatable imaging intelligence** at scale.

---

## Market Opportunity

MRI utilization continues to grow, particularly for chronic neurological conditions requiring repeated imaging. However, interpretation remains opaque to patients and inconsistent across timepoints.

The platform addresses a clear market need by:
- improving clarity and consistency of MRI-derived insights
- reducing follow-up clarification burden on care teams
- supporting longitudinal disease monitoring
- enabling scalable deployment without disrupting clinical workflows

---

## Competitive Advantage

Key differentiators include:
- Explainability-by-design rather than post-hoc interpretation
- Longitudinal tracking as a core feature
- Modular architecture adaptable to multiple neurological conditions
- Cloud-native deployment for scalability and cost control
- Strong foundation in validated research methods

---

## Deployment Architecture

The platform is designed for secure cloud deployment, with:
- encrypted storage and processing
- containerized analysis pipelines
- workflow orchestration for batch MRI processing
- role-based access and auditability
- compatibility with HIPAA-eligible cloud services

---

## Scope Clarification

This project:
- ✔ focuses on commercialization and deployment  
- ✔ supports pilot studies and early customers  
- ✔ delivers non-diagnostic decision-support outputs  

This project does **not**:
- ❌ replace clinician interpretation  
- ❌ provide medical diagnosis  
- ❌ bypass existing clinical workflows  

---

## Funding Alignment

This project is being prepared for submission under:

**NIH SBIR / STTR (NIBIB or NINDS)**  
Primary focus: commercialization of biomedical imaging technology

---

## Commercialization Pathway

Post-SBIR commercialization pathways include:
- hospital and imaging-center licensing
- per-study usage models
- enterprise deployment agreements
- expansion to additional neurological imaging use cases
