# Funding Strategy & Target Opportunities

This project is designed as a modular neuroimaging software and analysis resource that can support multiple funding pathways depending on maturity, scope, and use case. The following opportunities represent the **primary, secondary, and commercialization-aligned funding tracks** for the MS MRI Intelligence Pipeline.

## 1. RFA-OD-25-010  - https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/359648
### Primary Target — Research Software & Infrastructure (Best Fit)

**Sponsoring Body:**  
NIH Office of the Director (OD)

**Strategic Focus:**  
Cross-cutting biomedical research software, data infrastructure, and reusable computational resources.

**Why This Fits the Project:**  
The MS MRI Intelligence Pipeline is fundamentally a **research software resource**, not a single-disease hypothesis study. It provides reusable components for:
- MRI preprocessing and normalization
- Deep-learning-based lesion segmentation
- Atlas-based regional quantification
- Explainable, interpretable mapping from imaging findings to functional domains
- Longitudinal comparison across imaging timepoints

MS serves as the **initial use case**, but the architecture is intentionally generalizable across neurological imaging studies.

**Key Alignment Points:**
- Open, modular software architecture
- Reproducibility and versioned models/atlases
- FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
- Broad utility to NIH-funded investigators
- Clear sustainability and governance plans

**Positioning Guidance:**  
Applications should emphasize:
- software infrastructure
- community reuse and adoption
- long-term maintenance and extensibility  
Clinical deployment and commercialization should be explicitly out of scope.

## 2. PAR-25-238  - https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-238.html
### Secondary Target — Methods Development & Research Resource

**Mechanism Type:**  
Program Announcement with Review (PAR)

**Strategic Focus:**  
Investigator-initiated development of novel computational or analytic methods that advance biomedical research.

**Why This Fits (with Proper Framing):**  
The pipeline contributes a **methodological framework** that integrates:
- voxel-level segmentation
- atlas-based anatomical grounding
- region-level burden vectors
- explainable semantic interpretation

This framing positions the work as a **methods and resource contribution**, not a clinical tool.

**Key Alignment Points:**
- Methodological innovation in neuroimaging analysis
- Generalizable segmentation-to-interpretation workflows
- Validation, benchmarking, and reproducibility
- Dissemination as an open research resource

**Positioning Guidance:**  
Applications should avoid:
- hospital workflows
- patient-facing deployment
- product or revenue language  

Instead, emphasize:
- analytic rigor
- research utility
- extensibility to other imaging studies

## 3. NIH SBIR / STTR (NIBIB or NINDS)  - https://www.sbir.gov/
### Commercialization Track — Productization, Pilots, and Cloud Deployment

**Mechanism Type:**  
Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer

**Strategic Focus:**  
Translation of innovative biomedical technologies into deployable products.

**Why This Fits the Project:**  
Once validated as a research resource, the pipeline naturally evolves into a **scalable imaging intelligence platform** capable of supporting:
- hospital pilots
- patient-facing reporting
- secure cloud-based processing (e.g., AWS)
- longitudinal care support

**Key Alignment Points:**
- Clear commercialization pathway
- Non-diagnostic decision-support positioning
- Pilot studies with healthcare partners
- Secure, compliant cloud infrastructure
- Defined customer and market need

**Positioning Guidance:**  
This mechanism is appropriate for:
- AWS deployment
- operational scaling
- hospital and health-system pilots
- early revenue models  

Research infrastructure language should transition to **product readiness and validation**.

## Funding Roadmap Summary

| Stage | Mechanism | Primary Goal |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Research Infrastructure | RFA-OD-25-010 | Sustainable, reusable software resource |
| Methods & Validation | PAR-25-238 | Analytic rigor and generalizable methods |
| Translation & Scale | NIH SBIR/STTR | Product, pilots, and deployment |

## Strategic Note

These funding pathways are **complementary, not mutually exclusive**. Early support for software infrastructure and methods development de-risks later commercialization and accelerates adoption in clinical and operational environments.
